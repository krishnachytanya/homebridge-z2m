# Light
If the device definition from zigbee2mqtt contains one or more `exposes` entries of type `light` that at least have a feature named `state` (i.e. on/off), a [Lightbulb](https://developers.homebridge.io/#/service/Lightbulb) service will be created.
The table below shows how the different features within this `exposes` entry are mapped to characteristics.

| Name | Required access | Characteristic | Remarks |
|-|-|-|-|
| `state` | published, set | [On](https://developers.homebridge.io/#/characteristic/On) | Required |
| `brightness` | published, set | [Brightness](https://developers.homebridge.io/#/characteristic/Brightness) | |
| `color_temp` | published, set | [Color Temperature](https://developers.homebridge.io/#/characteristic/ColorTemperature) | |
| `color_hs` | published, set | [Hue](https://developers.homebridge.io/#/characteristic/Hue) and [Saturation](https://developers.homebridge.io/#/characteristic/Saturation) | Requires nested features `hue` and `saturation`. Prefered over `color_xy`. |
| `color_xy` | published, set | [Hue](https://developers.homebridge.io/#/characteristic/Hue) and [Saturation](https://developers.homebridge.io/#/characteristic/Saturation) | Requires nested features `x` and `y`. Values translated by plugin. |
